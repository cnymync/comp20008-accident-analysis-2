# comp20008-accident-analysis-2
This repository helps answer the research question: What combinations of weather, road, vehicle condition, and driver profiles are most strongly associated with high-risk accidents, and how can we use these to predict accident severity?
To reproduce the outputs from the group report, csv files obtained from the Victoria Police Records should be downloaded, more specifically, accident.csv, filtered_vehicle.csv, vehicle.csv, and person.csv.
To reproduce the KNN and Decision Tree code, the above datasets should be processed through the 3 preprocessing code such that a csv titled "finale.csv" is created which will be used as the cleaned dataset for the KNN and Decison Tree code. 
By doing so, the outputs displayed on the group reports can be obtained
